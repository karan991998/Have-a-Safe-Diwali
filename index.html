  <h1>🚫 STOP! That Link Could Be a Trick – Read This First! ⚠️</h1>

  <p>
    Before you dive into the Diwali fun 🪔 and open any link that comes your way — <strong>STOP ✋</strong> and <strong>THINK 💭</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the time when many fake or harmful links are shared. They may look like 🎁 Diwali offers, gifts, or festive messages... but some can be 🧨 dangerous. They can steal your 🔐 personal information or harm your 📱 phone.
  </p>

  <p>
    ✅ Only click on links you trust and always double-check who sent it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s keep this festival full of ✨ light, not 😨 fright.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wishing you a 🎆 Happy and Safe Diwali! 🪔
